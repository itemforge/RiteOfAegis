## Ingredients

    - sub roll (piantedosi)

    - capicola 

    - mortadella

    - provolone

    - salami
    ( ham & prosciutto is fine too but isn’t a deal-breaker)

    - iceberg or romaine lettuce 

    - sweet onion

    - tomato or roasted pepper

    - pickled Pepperoncinis

    - dill pickles

    - dried herbs & spices (You can go with fresh if you really want but it’s better dried)

        - Basil

        - oregano

        - garlic powder

    - olive oil & vinegar (alternatively you can use Mayo if you’re weird)

    - Wax/Parchment/foil/seran wrap

## Procedure

  >- Butterfly slice the roll leaving one side still intact

  >- bore out some of the bread, making a trench 

  >- fold or roll then layer the deli meats on the bottom

  >- layer the cheese over the meats

  >- Extremely thinly slice the lettuce, use a mandoline slicer if you have one or possibly even a food processor on the slice setting. 

  >- Thinly slice \ julienne onion

  >- fine chop the Pepperoncinis and pickles

  >- dice tomato or roasted pepper

  >- drizzle with olive oil and then with just enough vinegar to coat. You don’t have to measure it but aim for around a 3:1 ratio

  >- add all the seasoning with a big pinch of salt and black pepper

  >- Toss everything together to make a salad/slaw

  >- Stuff the salad mixture into the sub roll. 
  
  >- press the sub closed and wrap it with foil or paper.

> Even if you intend to eat it right away, wrapping the sandwich is necessary and shouldn’t be skipped. You need to trust me on this.
