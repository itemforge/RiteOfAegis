# Ingredients

    Bread Flour  525g (~3½ cups)

    Salt 12g (~2 tsp)

    Yeast 7g (~2 tsp)

    Water 395g (~1 2⁄3 cups)

# Procedure

>  -  Mix everything together, bloom the yeast if it makes you feel better about it.
>
>  -  Slowly add the water until theres no raw flour at the bottom of the bowl
>
  - Is the sticky wad of dough feel too wet? Stop adding water
  - Did you definitely add too much water? add a pinch of flour at a time til it feels right. Don’t use the wet hand, you’ll ruin your flour. 
>
>  -  Cover really and wait about 3 hours.
>
>  -  It should have inflated and filled the bowl. Put it in the fridge for up to a week
>
>  -  When you’re getting ready to bake, throw flour across a clean table and turn the dough out onto it. 
>
>  -  Shape, tuck, and roll the dough into a shape that resembles an overstuffed burrito.
>
>  -  Grease up a bread pan and plop the dough in.
>
>  -  Grease up a sheet of aluminum foil and build a little foil house cover over the pan, cooking spray side down. 
>
>  -  Wait for 4 more hours to a day. 
>
>  -  Preheat the oven for about half an hour to 450-475. Depending on the time of year and the oven this may take some experimenting. I like to put a muffin tin filled with water to make the oven nice and steamy. Start boiling big pot of water.
>
>  -  When the bread goes in, refill the muffin tin with boiling water on another rack. Bake for 20 minutes.
>
>  -  After 20 minutes, remove the foil roof and bake for another 20 minutes, refill the muffin tin.
>
>  -  Remove from oven, and turn out the loaf onto a cooling rack. Wait another 20 minutes for it to cool off.

No... seriously. I know a lot of recipes say "wait for it to cool" and a lot of times its fine. This isn't one of those cases. If you cut the bread before it totally cools you _will_ ruin it.
