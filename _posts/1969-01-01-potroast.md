# Ingredients
    Salt and freshly ground black pepper

    One 3- to 5-pound chuck roast 

    tablespoons olive oil

    onions, peeled and halved

    carrots, unpeeled, cut into 2-inch pieces

    1 cup red wine (not required)

    3 cups beef broth

    2 or 3 sprigs fresh rosemary

    2 or 3 sprigs fresh thyme (I insist you don’t skip this)
    
# Procedure

Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F.

>    Generously salt and pepper the chuck roast. Like almost too much

>    Heat the olive oil in large pot over medium heat. Add the halved onions to the pot til they are good and browned, Remove the onions to a plate. (or Dutch oven or cast iron whatever)

>    Throw the carrots into the same very hot pot and toss them around a bit until slightly browned, about a minute or so. Put the carrots aside with the onions.

>    If needed, add a bit more olive oil and get the pot screamin hot. Sear the meat about a minute per side, and don’t forget the ends. Put the roast aside on a plate.

 >   With the burner still on high, use either red wine or broth (about a cup, just eyeball a hearty splash) to deglaze the pot, scraping the bottom with a fork or whisk. Place the roast back into the pot and add enough stock to cover the meat halfway.

>    Add in the onions and the carrots, along with the herbs.

>    Put the lid on, then roast for about an hour per pound. Poke it with a fork. It should have nearly no resistance and nearly shred. Otherwise, you have to be patient.
