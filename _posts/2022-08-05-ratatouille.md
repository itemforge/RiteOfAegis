# Ingredients
#### For the thing itself
    2 eggplants
    6 roma tomatoes
    2 yellow squashes (or summer squash)
    2 zucchinis

#### For the sauce
    3 tablespoons olive oil
    onion, diced
    garlic, crushed and minced
    bell pepper, diced (any color)
    salt & pep (or anchovie paste)
    crushed tomatoes *
    fresh basil, chopped
    boullion

###### * If you have fresh tomatoes
> - cut the tomatoes in half
> - place them flat side down in a casserole dish
> - drizle with olice oil, like almost too much
> - roast at 400 for 30 minutes
The skins will darken and turn black, I promise you they are not burning
> - once they cool a bit, pluck the skins off with your fingers or with chop sticks or tongs
> - if you absolutely hate seeds then mush them through a sieve before blending
> - sweat the onions then add the garlic and basil
> - add the peppers
> - once the peppers soften, add the tomatos either from the can or freshly made
> - use a hand blender. Any blender will do but I like the hand blender. In a pinch, you can use a potato masher and a lot of violence. 
> - once everything is good and saucy, sneak in the anchovie paste before anyone realizes what it is. This is also when to add the boullion.

#### Flavor

    basil
    garlic, crushed
    parsley
    thyme
    salt
    pepper
    olive oil

# Procedure

  > -  Preheat the oven for 375ËšF
  > -  Slice the eggplant, tomatoes, squash, and zucchini into thin disks. Remember pogs? kinda like that. Don't over do it and cut yourself. Use the slicing function on the food processor or a mandolin if you have one. 
  > - Take out the veggies and let them cool
  > -  Arrange the sliced veggies in alternating patterns, (for example, eggplant, tomato, squash, zucchini) on top of the sauce from the outer edge to the middle of the pan. Season with salt and pepper.
  > - chop the herbs and mix with olive oil to make a paste, almost til it looks like pesto. Paint this over the veggies
  > -  Cover the pan with foil or the dutch oven and bake for 40 minutes. Uncover, then bake for another 20 minutes, until the vegetables are softened. If you are using a dutch oven, add 10 to 15 minutes.
