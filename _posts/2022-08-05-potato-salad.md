# Ingredients
```
3 lb. red potatoes
2/3 c. mayonnaise
1/2 c. sour cream
2 tbsp. white wine vinegar
1 big squirt Dijon mustard
1 tsp. kosher salt
1 tsp. ground black pepper
2 stalks celery, chopped (optional, but trust me on this one)
1/4 c. chopped dill 
6 slices to half a pound cooked bacon, chopped, nice and crispy
* optional: hardboiled egg for every other spud, sliced, crushed, combined
```

# Procedure

- half or quarter the tots, put them in a pot,  fill with water til theyre just barely covered salt the heck out of em - boil ~ 15-20 m til you can push a fork through effortlessly - drain, let them cool completely 
- add everything but the potatoes and bacon in a bowl and mix
- add the potatoes 
- add the bacon
- optional, hard boiled eggs chopped and mixed in
For something simpler, you cant go wrong with Danos for seasoning, Dukes Mayo, bacon, and a big squirt of dijon mustard

Two things:
1. You must taste test it. If it feels like it _needs_ something, try salt. My rule of thumb is (not just for potato salad but for cooking in general):
    - if something tastes like it needs something and you already added salt, the answer is acid (lemon juice, mustard, siracha, hot sauce etc.) 
    - if not salt or acid try for umami/earth/meaty (boullion, mushroom)
    - if not salt or acid or umami, try sweet (honey, raisons, appricots)
    - if you already added salt, acid, umami, sweet, maybe texture, add crunch (celery, crispy fried onions etc.)
    - if its none of those you probably messed up and need to order a pizza.
