## Ingredients

- potato 
- onion or shallot or leek 
-garlic, bulbs or scapes 
-cooking oil or butter 
-spices and herbs (dried or fresh) - 
  - any combination of onion, garlic, orange peel, lemon peel, rosemary, dill, sage, - _Basically whatever you prefer and have on hand_
- tomato paste 
- beef bouillon 
    - _(optional) or mushrooms or anchovies. Depending on what you use, mind your salt_ 
- Egg 
- Carrots/beets -  _(root and or leaves), bokchoy, swiss chard, celery (stalk and leaves)_
- _optional: cheese_


## Procedure:  

- Dice potatoes, boil 10m till soft 
- add oil garlic onion to pan 
- Add potatoes after you drain and toss until they start to get crispy. 
- If you are using sausage, add that first. 
- Protip: totally optional but a light dusting of corn starch will make the tots extra crispy. 
- Slowly just add everything into the pan, tossing as you go. 
- The egg goes last. Just kidding, the cheese does, if you are adding it. Just kidding, the chives do, if you are adding it.
- After you add the egg, let it sit for a bit and form a bit. Give the pan a wiggle to spread out more. This comes down to preference but I don’t like my eggs to feel like baby food. You can also whisk them like a scramble. It’s up to you, I’m not the boss of you, follow your heart.
  
###### Context: 

 ###### _This is as close as I get to an anecdote on a recipe but context helps. I make this whenever I "thin out" my garden beds. Spring to summer. In the fall, this is a stew or a soup. I use a lot of seedings, they are good. It's hard to mess this up, basically, add whatever you have on hand usually from the garden but leftovers and anything from the fridge "about to go" works too - leftover rice, Italian sausage or chorizo is great here, BBQ does really well._
