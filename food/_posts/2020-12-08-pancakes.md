# Ingredients

    1 ½ cups flour

    3 ½ tsp baking powder

    1 tsp salt

    1 tbsp sugar

    1 ¼ cups milk

    1 egg

    3 tbsp butter, melted

    Cap-full of vanilla (not required)

    A big pinch of cinnamon (not required)

# Procedure

> -   Beat egg, then add wet ingredients
> -   In a separate bowl mix together the dry ingredients
> -   combine the wet and dry bowls. Do not over stir and this may take some trial and error. Mix until theres no raw flour but you feel like 3 more turns will finish it. Don’t finish mixing at that point.
> -   Pan greased with bacon fat or butter, get it hot but not enough for the butter to burn. 
> -   I use a quarter cup measuring cup to scoop the batter into the pan but it’s never exact. Go with your heart
> -   Once you see bubbles kind of form, flip once.
> -   with a wide spatula sneak a peek under the pancake. Once you realize you’ll never be able to actually see how done it is, flip it.
> -   Stack pancakes on a plate, adding a pad of butter between each as you cook the rest.
