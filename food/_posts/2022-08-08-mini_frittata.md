# Ingredients

```
eggs
sour cream
milk or cream
salt and pep
butter or cooking spray
seasoning (any herb / spice blend - I use danOs or herbs de provence)
fillings (spinach, bok choy, swiss chard, tomatoes)
cheese (cheddar, gouda, parmesan, feta)
```

# Hardware

```
Mixing bowl
Muffin pan
Whisk, fork, or hand blender
Oven
cooling rack
```

# Preperation note

- If you are working with fresh spinach, bok choy, or swiss chard, you will want to clean, trim and blanch these first. I usually do this when I pluck them from the garden so I have a block of frozen greens to work with. 
    - Frozen spinach is pretty good for this.
    
- If you are using cherry tomatos, half them. 
If you are using jalapenos, remove the seeds and spines from them and slice them into little rings. I like them spicy so I leave some seeds in and dice them almost into a mince. 
- Crush your garlic into a paste. 
- Mince onions
- Shred cheese
- Etc. etc.

# Procedure

> - Crack an egg for every other muffin cup in your pan. If you want big fluffy frittatas, this can be 1:1
> - preheat the oven to 400
> - spray butter or grease the muffin tin. Don't use muffin liners.
> - beat the eggs and whisk in cream and a big dollop of sour cream until it looks like really frothy orange juice. 
> - mix in any of your fillings. I like to use a hand blender to break down the any leafy pieces
> - salt and pep and season accordingly. No wrong ansers, try taco or ramen seasoning. Feel free to experiment but these are fine plain with salt and pep the first time you make it.
> - mix in a shredded cheese, parm, feta to your liking
> - mix everything together. 
> - Layer the bottoms of the pan cups with some shredded cheese. Cheddar is good for this, it will create a little crust on the bottom. If you greased first it wont stick.
> - pour in a Â¼cup into each muffin tin cup
> - once each muffin cup has some egg, gauge how much egg mixture you have left. You might want to make slightly bigger frittatas or just make a second batch.
> - either way, top each one with another sprinkling of cheese, again I like cheddar for this but follow your heart here.
> - Bake 15 - 20 minutes until they brown and firm. Stick a fork or chopstick through the middle of one til it comes out clean
> - let them cool for a few minutes before carefully seperating from the pan with a rubber spatula or chopstick and move them to the cooling rack
>   - DO NOT USE METAL TOOLS IF THE PAN IS NONSTICK.
>   - Tefflon in a solid form is inert and [probably wont give you early onset alzhiemers or cancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FNNKhVoUu8) but it _will_ ruin your pan.

Let these cool off and them store them in the fridge or freezer. They are good for a snack or quick bite on the go. Have them just on their own or warm them up in the toaster oven or air fryer if you like them "fresh"; just use a little foil or parchment paper so they dont melt into the grate. I think they're fine cold with a little sriracha but you might prefer ketchup.
