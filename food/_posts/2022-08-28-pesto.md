# Ingredients 
```
- about two cups of basil, packed
- 3/4 cup grated parmessan cheese
- 3/4 cup olive oil 
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1/4 cup pine nuts
- juice of one lemon (optional)
  - (optionl) zest of one lemon
```

# Procedure
 - Blend everything til a creamy consistency. Add more olive oil if needed. 
 
 Don't go light on the basil; Two cups packed. This should be by weight but my scale was dirty.

Taste it. Add stuff as you see fit.
