# Ingredients

    onion

    squash

    garlic

    chicken broth

    fettuccine or linguine or spaghetti

    pancetta or bacon, chopped

# Preparation

> -  Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add pancetta or bacon. Reduce heat, dont let it burn. Add sage or whatever herbs you have on hand that work here. Once crispy, remove the bacon and set aside.
> -  Add squash, onion, and garlic. Hit it with salt and pepper. Once onion is translucent, add broth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until squash is soft. Liquid should cook off and reduce by around half. Hit it with blender til its all smooth and consistent. 
> -  Large pot, salted water, cook pasta. Save a cup of the starchy pasta water.
> -   Combine pasta, squash, a quarter cup of the pasta water, toss and fold, pasta water until it reaches a texture you like. It should be able to thoroughly coat all the pasta. Add in the bacon/pancetta last.
> -   Plate, season, serve.
