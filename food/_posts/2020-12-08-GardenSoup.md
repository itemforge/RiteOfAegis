# Ingredients 

(not all are necessary):

    Garlic

    Onions or shallots or whatever you have on hand.

    herbs de provence - substitute with whatever herbs you have on hand

    ginger (powder or grated)

    chicken stock (or bouillon. I dont care)

    Chicken thighs (again, use the whole bird, I prefer thighs for this)

    Veg washed, rough rough chopped, trimmed, etc. (Carrots, Celery, Baby bokchoy, spinach, radishes, beets, whatever you pull up from the garden, whatever you have on hand)

# Procedure:

> -    sauté shallots, garlic, ginger with butter or oil
> -    add herbs + cumin to sauté 
> -    add chicken and veg then hit it with salt and pepper until right after the point you feel that might have been too much
> -    add stock/broth/enough water to cover everything about two knuckles deep. Eyeball it. Don’t stick your finger in the pot.
> -    Bring to a boil, add the rest of your veg, then simmer forever. 

  Poke the chicken with a fork, did it shred immediately? If not keep simmering. Once it does, enjoy whenever.
