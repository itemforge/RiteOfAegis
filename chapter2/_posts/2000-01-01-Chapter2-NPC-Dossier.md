# Aife

![Aife](https://i.imgur.com/VfewCBA.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
Aife is apparent leader of the Rite of Aegis.  She is a tall elf with erudite presence.  She speaks with an Irish lilt and hails from Foren in Empire Strand.  The details of her background are unknown.


# Onanwatgo 
Onanwatgo is a skilled diviner wizard in the employ of Rite of Aegis.  He's a human of average height with deeply tan skin and braided black hair.  He speaks common and Iroquoian 

I'm having great difficulty finding a picture of an Iroquoian wizard that doesn't involve head dress and I'm unsure of the significance of them so I'm leaving him to ur imagination for now.

# Fedir
Fedir is a short half elf bard.  He is very wiry with a mustache and goatee and round glasses.  He is abrasive.  He speaks with a Slavic accent and plays a balalaika.
Fedir found you and brought you to saloon.
