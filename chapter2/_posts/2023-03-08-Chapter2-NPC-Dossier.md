Onanwatgo is a skilled diviner wizard in the employ of Rite of Aegis.  He's a human of average height with deeply tan skin and braided black hair.  He speaks common and Iroquoian 

I'm having great difficulty finding a picture of an Iroquoian wizard that doesn't involve head dress and I'm unsure of the significance of them so I'm leaving him to ur imagination for now.

## Fedir Bayuk
