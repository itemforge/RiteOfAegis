Rupert grew up in a small isolated village in the Rime plains. Growing up there he fell in love with an elven woman named Delia, he worked on his craft in a small hut a few miles from the town to avoid the hammering of his tools disrupting the quaint lives of the villagers. Delia and him had a daughter named Piota who was a rambunctious little runt always getting into trouble with village elder and no sense of authority. With Dwendalion patrols scouting the area they'd frequently barge into the village terrorizing the folks with their false sense of law and the righteousness of their so called "empire". Nothing but murderous cunts if you ask me.

One day during their patrols my lass threw a rock towards them as they left. Bless her but she hadn't the strength to actually hit them as their horses trotted away. The bloody cunts put my lass to the fucking sword for her so called transgression to the "Kings soldiers". I returned that day to find my girl in a bloody fucking heap cradled in my slain loves fucking arms. The bastards let their wolf knaw at their fucking corpses, torched my home as a lesson to those that do not respect their future lords and ladies.

I spent four fucking days tracking them before catching them that night camping. The dumb cunts thought nobody would dare attack them, let alone at night. Our fucking lords to much of cowards to assert their ancestral rights to the land.

I slew all of them hacking them into fucking bits before that fucking wolf took my eye.be it shame or fear of the repressions I couldn't tell you, but I fled to the North. Finding a town called Palebank to call my home. I dream of a free land, free of the tyranny of so called leaders that force tithes to a point below destitution. Those cunts will pay for what they've done, I care not for the means of how; but their Empire will fall be it to my hand or another's.
