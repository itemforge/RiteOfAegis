> _These notes are from my scratchpad that I’ve accumulated hacks and tricks over the years. Most of them are incoherent, incomplete thoughts and incredibly biased to my workspace, my workstyle, locally set aliases, and whatever I was doing when I scribbled them. I am sharing them here for my personal posterity, and they won’t likely age well either. If they happen to help you, excellent - pay it forward. If they are wrong, or there is a mistake or anything that can be improved, please tell me. I shouldn’t have to say this, but never run a command without being sure what it does, and don’t blindly copy-paste commands from the internet._
