# Why you are reading this?

 - You need to resize a disk on a linux system. 
 - You asked me about it and I sent you this link 
 or 
 - you are me and I forgot how to resize a disk because despite having done this a billion times I can never remember all the steps. 
 
I've adjusted this note a number of times over the years for a wide range of users with a wide range of experience. So I will assume very basic linux background and will explain as much as possible with this procedure.

The first assumption I am going to make is that you've already determined that you are working with LVM. If you aren't sure, here is how you can check:

1. check fstab
 ` cat /etc/fstab `

 [fstab](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/etc-fstab) is the linux 'file system table'. It tells the system what to mount at boot and chances are the disk you are working with should be here. 

- if you see `UUID=[some long string]` or `/dev/sda[some letter]` then you have a physical partition. What you are looking for is `/dev/mapper/sda[some letter]`


2. Check if there are already any logical volumes
`lvdisplay` will display any logical volumes as well as their path, name, group name, and size.

The next assumption I am going to make is that you have either physically installed another disk or added one in esxi or whichever VM manager you are using.

# Create Partitions

So now you have an unpartitioned disk. You need to first get the disk ready by creating a partition. 

use `fdisk -l` to confirm and identify that disk. You will see the existing disk (probably `/dev/sda/` but your mileage may vary as your system may be set up differently) with it's partitions and a new disk `/dev/sdb` without any partitions. This is the one you've added. Use cfdisk to add a partition:

```
cfdisk /dev/sdb 
```
or whichever is the new disk you've added. It may be something different such as sdc, just make sure you are working with the correct one matching the size of the disk you added

select the options `new` -> `primary` -> [`default partition`] -> `beginning`

use `fdisk -l` again to confirm the new disk now has a workable partition. 

# Create physical volumes

Use the pvcreate command to create physical volumes.

```
pvcreate /dev/sdb1
# then check again with pvdisplay
pvdisplay 
```
despite the name "physical volume" all of these lvm objects are logical 'containers' for one another. 
Physical disk contains partions which contain the physical volumes which will belong to a virtual group. Virtual groups can 'own' multiple physical volumes. Virtual groups contain logical volumes. Logical volumes are what we will ultimately mount. 

# Create Virtual Group
You need to create the virtual group that will contain your new physical volumes.
```
vgcreate new_vg /dev/sdb1
```

Create Virtual Group
Add any new physical volumes to a virtual group with
``` 
vgextend new_vg /dev/sdb1 
```
This will extend the virtual group to use the rest of the new disk.

# Create Logical Volumes
From this virtual group you will create logical volumes which is what will be mounted as before.

```
 lvcreate -L 5000 -n vol01 new_vg
```
This will create a 5GB "partition".

Now just like an actual physical disk, this just needs a file system. 
```
# mkfs.ext3 -m 0 /dev/mynew_vg/vol01
```
Note that this command will use the entire logical volume partition. In your case you may want something more specific. 

# Update fstab
Add a new line in your fstab with `vim /etc/fstab` for the new logical partition.

This mount will need a directory as a mount point. 

```
mkdir /foo
```
This may be determined by the disk you were resizing to begin with. 
Now that you have a mount point, you can mount the new partition with `mount -a`
- validate the new disk space with `df` and see that you may still need to extend to to use all this new space.

# Extend logical volume

`resize2fs /dev/new_vg/vol01`

# final notes
Along this procedure, I usually run `lvdisplay` `vgdisplay` `pgdisplay` `fdisk -l` over and over and over to make sure I am copypasta the correct names and paths

> _These notes are from my scratchpad that I've accumulated hacks and tricks over the years. Most of them are incoherent, incomplete thoughts and incredibly biased to my workspace, my workstyle, locally set aliases, and whatever I was doing at the time when I scribbled them. I am sharing them here for my personal posterity and they won't likely age well either. If they happen to help you, awesome - pay it forward. If they are wrong, or there is a mistake or can be improved, [please tell me](https://github.com/mroysterhead/mroysterhead.github.io/issues/new). I shouldn't have to say this but never run a command without being absolutely sure what it does and don't blindly copy paste commands from the internet._
